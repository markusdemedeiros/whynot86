# WhyNot86
A little collection of Y86 programs. Why not?

## Description of Programs:
-  `wolfram-automata.s`: Simulates the Wolfram cellular automata within a register! `register-formatter.py` is included to help visualize the results. 

- `choo-choo.s`: Small, self modifying program which travels downward on the stack overwriting memory with itself.

- `functional-y86.s`: Uses a data hazard to implement functional programming. Includes methods for creating new functions via function composition, and evaluation of arbitrary functions at runtime. In the future, I plan to implement polymorphism and other monads.
