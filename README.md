# WhyNot86
A little collection of Y86 programs. Why not?

## Currently implemented:
-  `wolfram-automata.s`: Simulates the Wolfram cellular automata within a register! `register-formatter.py` is included to help visualize the results. 

- `choo-choo.s`: Small, self modifying program which travels downward on the stack overwriting memory with itself.
